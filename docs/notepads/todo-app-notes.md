# Todo Application Notes

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack Todo application built with React, TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete todos, as well as mark them as completed.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `server`: Backend API built with Express and MongoDB
- `client`: Frontend application built with React and TypeScript

## Frontend Structure

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, and is organized as follows:

- `src/components`: React components for the application
  - `TodoList.tsx`: Component for displaying all todos
  - `TodoItem.tsx`: Component for displaying a single todo
  - `TodoForm.tsx`: Component for adding new todos
- `src/services`: Services for interacting with the backend
  - `api.ts`: Service for making API calls to the backend
- `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `Todo.ts`: Type definition for a Todo item

## Backend Structure

The backend is built with Express and MongoDB, and is organized as follows:

- `models`: Mongoose models for the application
  - `Todo.js`: Model for a Todo item
- `routes`: Express routes for the application
  - `todos.js`: Routes for Todo CRUD operations
- `controllers`: Controllers for handling business logic
  - `todoController.js`: Controller for Todo CRUD operations
- `middleware`: Middleware for the application
  - `errorHandler.js`: Middleware for handling errors

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/todos`: Get all todos
- `GET /api/todos/:id`: Get a specific todo
- `POST /api/todos`: Create a new todo
- `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Update a todo
- `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Delete a todo

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication
- Add categories for todos
- Add due dates for todos
- Add priority levels for todos
- Add filtering and sorting options
- Add search functionality
- Add dark mode
- Add mobile app with React Native
